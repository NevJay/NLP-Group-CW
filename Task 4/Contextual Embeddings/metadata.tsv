EC
MINISTERS
AGREE
NEED
FOR
BIG
STEEL
CLOSURES
European
Community
(
EC
)
industry
ministers
today
declared
there
is
a
need
for
a
massive
round
of
closures
of
steel
plants
to
bring
capacity
in
the
12-country
bloc
into
reasonable
balance
with
demand
.
The
ministers
were
meeting
to
discuss
a
plan
for
voluntary
plant
closures
drawn
up
by
the
industry
lobby
group
Eurofer
which
it
calculates
would
cost
around
22,000
jobs
.
Diplomats
said
that
in
their
initial
reactions
to
the
scheme
,
most
ministers
declared
it
was
a
useful
basis
for
discussion
,
but
did
not
go
nearly
far
enough
.
Eurofer
says
it
has
identified
scope
for
the
closure
of
plants
which
have
an
annual
capacity
of
15.26
mln
tonnes
,
provided
the
companies
concerned
can
be
fully
repaid
by
the
EC
or
national
governments
for
redundancy
and
other
social
costs
.
But
EC
Executive
Commission
sources
said
Industry
Commissioner
Karl-Heinz
Narjes
told
ministers
today
that
30
mln
tonnes
of
annual
capacity
was
excess
to
requirements
and
should
be
closed
by
the
end
of
1990
.
He
said
the
Eurofer
plan
in
particular
fails
to
pinpoint
the
scope
for
closure
in
heavy
hot-rolled
wide-strip
products
,
typically
produced
in
plants
employing
thousands
of
people
.
The
sources
said
no
minister
challenged
Narjes
'
analysis
that
four
or
five
hot-rolled
wide-strip
lines
would
have
to
close
.
They
said
ministers
agreed
that
the
Eurofer
plan
should
be
expanded
and
developed
through
meetings
among
the
industry
body
,
the
Commission
and
representatives
of
member
states
.
However
,
diplomats
said
it
was
clear
from
today's
discussions
that
such
meetings
will
be
difficult
.
They
said
member
states
are
split
on
whether
to
reduce
the
scope
of
a
quota
production
system
,
which
at
present
protects
EC
steelmakers
from
the
full
force
of
competition
for
65
pct
of
their
products
,
while
talks
on
the
closure
plan
proceed
.
It
was
also
clear
that
there
will
be
tough
talks
on
which
EC
member
states
should
bear
the
brunt
of
the
closures
and
on
how
much
funding
for
help
to
those
thrown
out
of
work
should
come
from
Community
coffers
.
German
minister
Martin
Bangemann
said
his
country
's
steel
industry
,
the
largest
in
the
EC
,
should
not
suffer
proportionately
more
than
others
,
German
sources
said
.
But
British
diplomats
said
their
minister
,
Giles
Shaw
,
insists
that
the
profitability
of
companies
should
be
taken
into
account
.
The
state
owned
British
Steel
Corporation
,
benefitting
from
massive
recent
write-offs
of
its
accumulated
debts
,
is
currently
one
of
the
few
EC
steel
companies
in
the
black
.
Ministers
were
this
afternoon
trying
to
agree
a
joint
statement
on
the
Eurofer
plan
and
the
situation
in
the
industry
.
EC
AND
COMECON
ENDS
TALKS
WITH
PROGRESS
The
European
Community
(
EC
)
and
Soviet-led
Comecon
ended
talks
here
,
having
made
progress
on
setting
up
formal
trade
relations
,
but
no
breakthrough
because
of
Comecon
's
refusal
to
recognise
West
Berlin
as
part
of
the
EC
,
delegates
said
.
Negotiators
were
trying
to
reach
agreement
on
the
draft
of
a
joint
declaration
setting
up
official
relations
after
30
years
of
mutual
non-recognition
.
John
Maslen
,
head
of
the
EC
delegation
,
told
Reuters
as
he
emerged
from
the
final
session
:
``
We
made
some
progress
,
but
we
have
called
for
another
meeting
.
''
Officials
,
who
asked
not
to
be
named
,
said
the
Comecon
team
had
refused
to
accept
a
clause
in
the
draft
declaration
which
would
recognise
West
Berlin
as
part
of
the
12-nation
EC
.
Under
the
1957
Treaty
of
Rome
all
contracts
and
agreements
signed
by
the
Community
must
contain
this
territorial
clause
stipulating
West
Berlin
is
an
integral
part
of
the
EC
.
An
EC
negotiator
taking
part
in
the
three-day
talks
said
:
``
We
wanted
the
territorial
clause
in
,
but
Comecon
said
no
.
''
A
joint
statement
issued
after
the
talks
said
progress
was
made
towards
clarifying
positions
,
but
another
meeting
would
be
necessary
to
complete
the
work
.
Any
decision
in
principle
to
set
up
relations
would
require
approval
by
the
Community
's
Council
of
Ministers
and
by
the
executive
committee
of
Comecon
.
Zdzislaw
Kuroski
,
deputy
director
of
Comecon
,
who
heads
the
East
bloc
delegation
,
told
Reuters
ahead
of
today
's
session
:
``
We
have
narrowed
our
differences
on
a
range
of
questions
,
but
not
on
all
questions
.
''
Asked
whether
Comecon
would
accept
EC
insistence
that
any
joint
declaration
stipulate
West
Berlin
as
part
of
the
Community
,
he
replied
:
``
This
question
is
not
contained
in
the
draft
which
our
side
presented
.
''
West
German
diplomats
said
they
would
insist
on
including
the
clause
on
West
Berlin
in
any
EC-Comecon
agreement
.
The
talks
followed
an
earlier
round
between
the
two
trading
blocs
here
last
September
and
the
first-ever
direct
talks
between
the
EC
and
the
Soviet
Union
on
establishing
diplomatic
relations
in
January
.
The
EC
trades
with
individual
Comecon
member
states
despite
non-recognition
of
Comecon
.
Last
year
,
the
EC
had
a
five
billion
dlr
trade
deficit
with
East
European
states
,
about
half
the
deficit
of
the
previous
year
,
due
to
a
drop
in
the
price
of
Soviet
oil
imported
by
the
EC
.
U.K.
MONEY
DATA
MAY
EASE
RATE
CUT
,
ANALYSTS
SAY
Slower
than
expected
growth
in
Britain's
narrow
M0
money
supply
measure
in
February
will
help
spur
a
further
cut
in
U.K.
Interest
rates
if
a
surge
in
sterling's
value
requires
such
a
move
,
economic
analysts
said
.
M0
,
the
only
targeted
money
supply
measure
left
after
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
Nigel
Lawson
scrapped
the
official
target
for
the
broad
sterling
M3
measure
in
his
1987
budget
speech
on
Tuesday
,
fell
an
adjusted
3/4
to
one
pct
in
February
.
On
an
annual
basis
,
this
put
M0
growth
at
four
to
4-1/2
pct
,
in
the
middle
of
the
1987
target
of
two
to
six
pct
.
``
The
M0
data
are
much
better
than
we
expected
,
''
said
Robert
Thomas
,
economist
at
Greenwell
Montagu
Securities
.
He
and
other
analysts
said
while
the
better
than
expected
M0
figures
alone
would
not
be
sufficient
to
trigger
a
new
interest
rate
cut
,
they
removed
an
obstacle
to
such
a
move
.
Thomas
noted
the
rise
in
M0
had
been
kept
in
check
despite
buoyant
retail
sales
in
February
,
advancing
an
adjusted
2.2
pct
after
a
fall
of
the
same
size
in
January
.
Analysts
said
the
M0
measure
,
reflecting
variations
in
consumer
demand
rather
than
real
inflation
prospects
,
was
not
an
adequate
indicator
to
determine
interest
rates
.
``
The
authorities
still
seem
to
want
to
pretend
that
M0
is
important
...
In
practice
,
it
is
likely
to
be
the
exchange
rate
and
the
election
which
call
the
tune
,
''
Lloyds
Merchant
bank
chief
economist
Roger
Bootle
wrote
in
a
budget
comment
.
Richard
Jeffrey
,
economist
at
stockbrokers
Hoare
Govett
,
said
in
a
comment
:
``
It
is
unlikely
that
(
Lawson
)
will
respond
to
signals
from
M0
alone
...
Reinforcement
from
exchange
rate
trends
is
necessary
before
action
is
taken
.
''
``
With
the
Chancellor
making
clear
that
policy
manoeuvres
are
made
in
response
to
signals
from
this
narrow
money
variable
,
the
City
has
been
forced
to
take
it
seriously
,
''
he
added
.
Noting
this
point
,
Thomas
said
market
fears
at
the
end
of
last
year
of
an
M0
overshoot
had
now
disappeared
.
This
removed
a
potential
obstacle
to
a
further
cut
in
U.K.
Base
lending
rates
if
foreign
demand
for
sterling
pushed
up
the
pound
above
unofficial
targets
,
analysts
said
.
Such
targets
are
believed
to
have
been
secretly
agreed
between
finance
ministers
of
the
Group
of
Five
and
Canada
at
their
Paris
meeting
last
month
,
they
added
.
U.K.
Base
rates
have
been
cut
twice
by
half
a
point
since
the
Paris
agreement
,
once
on
March
11
,
and
again
yesterday
when
foreign
demand
for
sterling
surged
in
reaction
to
a
sharp
cut
in
1987
government
borrowing
targets
contained
in
the
budget
.
They
stand
at
10
pct
now
,
and
foreign
exchange
dealers
and
analysts
expect
them
to
shed
another
half-point
in
the
coming
week
.
Analysts
shrugged
off
as
largely
irrelevant
a
higher
than
expected
increase
in
February
sterling
M3
,
which
pushed
the
annual
growth
rate
to
almost
19
pct
,
well
above
the
previous
target
of
11
to
15
pct
.
Thomas
said
the
February
figures
seemed
to
indicate
the
improvement
in
sterling
M3
growth
witnessed
over
the
past
few
months
had
been
reversed
,
but
firm
conclusions
could
only
be
drawn
after
revised
data
are
released
on
March
31
.
Some
analysts
said
foreign
investors
had
long
ceased
to
watch
the
sterling
M3
target
,
and
Lawson
's
move
to
scrap
it
altogether
earlier
this
week
removed
whatever
was
left
of
its
credibility
as
a
key
factor
in
monetary
policy
.
U.S.
COURT
ALLOWS
OFFSHORE
ALASKAN
EXPLORATION
A
unanimous
Supreme
Court
ruled
that
oil
and
gas
exploration
can
proceed
on
two
tracts
off
the
Alaska
coast
which
were
leased
by
the
federal
government
to
eight
major
oil
companies
.
The
ruling
was
an
important
victory
for
the
oil
companies
and
the
Reagan
administration
's
controversial
off-shore
leasing
program
and
a
setback
for
two
small
Alaskan
villages
that
challenged
the
leases
by
claiming
damage
to
the
environment
.
The
administration
said
that
the
court-ordered
halt
in
drilling
had
created
uncertainty
over
the
4.2
billion
dlrs
paid
for
621
leases
off
the
shores
of
Alaska
since
December
1980
.
A
federal
appeals
court
ordered
the
oil
companies
to
halt
all
exploration
and
remove
all
drilling
rigs
from
two
tracts
in
the
Bering
Sea
off
Alaska
because
of
possible
harm
to
the
subsistence
needs
and
culture
of
native
Eskimos
.
But
the
Supreme
Court
said
the
appeals
court
was
wrong
in
issuing
an
injunction
halting
exploration
.
``
Here
,
injury
to
subsistence
resources
from
exploration
was
not
at
all
probable
,
''
Justice
Byron
White
wrote
for
the
court
.
``
And
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance
of
harms
was
the
fact
that
the
oil
companies
had
committed
approximately
70
mln
dlrs
to
exploration
to
be
conducted
during
the
summer
of
1985
which
they
would
have
lost
without
chance
of
recovery
had
exploration
been
enjoined
,

had
said
that
voiding
previously
granted
leases
would
result
in
staggering
financial
losses
.
The
first
lease
sale
in
1983
involved
2.4
mln
acres
and
generated
318
mln
dlrs
while
the
second
lease
sale
in

covered

produced

.
Administration
officials
,
saying
the
lease
sales
were
preceded
by
an
intense
environmental
impact
study
,
denied
that
the
oil
and

exploration
would
hurt
subsistence
resources

villages

hunting

billion
dlrs
in

to
use
to
buy
a
pharmaceutical
company
,
Chairman
Milan
Panic
said
.
At
the
company

annual
meeting
,
he
said
an
acquisition
could
take
place
in
the
next
24
months
.
``
The
company
has
nearly
two
billion
dlrs
available
for
acquisition
today
,
''
Panic
said
,
adding
,
``
We
are
investigating
a
number
of
companies
.
''
One
company
being
studied
could
possibly
be
acquired
on
a
friendly
basis
,
he
said
.
Panic
also
said
he
intends
to
seek
board
approval
today
to
repurchase
up
to
three
mln
ICN
common
shares
.
Discussing
the
possibility
of
an
acquisition
,
Panic
said
the
such
a
purchase
is
necessary
because
ICN
's
current
marketing
capability
would
not
be
sufficient
to
support
distribution
of
the
company
's
products
,
given
ICN's
expectations
for
market
growth
worldwide
.
ICN
's
principal
product
is
ribavirin
,
also
known
as
Virazole
.
The
drug
is
marketed
in
a
number
of
countries
and
described
as
a
broad-based
anti-viral
.
The
company
has
said
its
possible
applications
include
treatment
of
some
types
of
hepatitis
,
herpes
,
influenza
,
childhood
diseases
and
hemorrhagic
fevers
.
ICN
has
been
the
focus
of

of
Virazole
,
which
has
undergone

trials
as
a
possible
treatment
of

Panic
said
today
he

the
drug
with
regard
to
AIDS
until
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
completes
its
review

30
PCT
OF

INTEREST
Ohio
Edison
Co
said
it
has
completed
the
sale
and
leaseback
of
30
pct
of
its
30
pct
interest
in
Unit
One
of
the
Perry
Nuclear
Power
Plant
,
receiving
509
mln
dlrs
for
the
interest
.
The
utility
said
the
share
of
its
interest
in
the
1,205
megawatt
generating
plant
was
sold
to
a
group
of
institutional
investors
which
leased
it
back
to
the
company
for
a
period
of
about
29
years
at
a
negotiated
lease
payment
rate
.
Ohio
Edison
said
the
proceeds
will
be
used
to
finance
the
rest
of
its
1987
construction
program
and
repay
bank
loans
incurred
for
the
retirement
of
high-interest
long-term
debt
.
Ohio
Edison
did
not
detail
the
lease
payments
,
but
it
said
the
``
payments
will
reduce
the
amount
of
revenue
the
company
will
need
to
cover
our
investment
in
Perry
,
which
translates
into
savings
for
our
customers
.
''
The
utility
said
it
projects
the
financing
could
reduce
the
amount
of
annual
revenue
needed
by
about
20
mln
dlrs
.
It
plans
on
filing
a
rate
application
with
the
Public
Utilities
Commission
of
Ohio
to
recover
the
Perry
costs
later
this
year
.
It
said
the
sale
and
leaseback
was
attractive
to
the
investors
because
they
could
take
quicker
advantage
of
tax
benefits
than
the
utility
could
.

1.5
billion
dlr
takeover
offer
,
an
American
Motors
spokesman
said
.
The
spokesman
reiterated
statements
made
earlier
in
the
week
that
the
regularly
scheduled
meeting
was
being
held
.
The
spokesman
would
not
comment
on
recurring
speculation
that
the
board
might
receive
a
higher
offer
from
Chrysler
.
Analysts
have
said
the
fact
that
American
Motors
'
stock
has
remained
above
the
four
dlrs
a
share
Chrysler
offer
could
lead
the
larger
company
to
raise
its
bid
.
The
American
Motors
spokesman
said
he
had
not
seen
any
indication
that
a
higher
offer
would
be
received
from
Chrysler
,
although
he
added
,
``
I
do
n't
know
what
the
conversation
is
in
the
meeting
.
''
He
repeated
statements
made
earlier
in
the
week
by
the
automaker
that
today
's
meeting
will
probably
not
result
in
a
final
decision
on
the
Chrysler
bid
.
``
The
board
first
apprised
the
proposal
on
the
11th
(
of
March
)
.
I
suspect
there
will
be
several
more

TO
FORM
NEW
DIVIDEND
POLICY
Middle
South
Utilities
Inc
is
taking
a
conversative
approach
to
formulating
a
new
common
stock
dividend
policy
,
chairman
Edwin
Lupberger
said
.
He
told
securities
analysts
that
when
the
company
's
common
dividend
is
resumed
,
``
the
initial
rate
will
appear
conservative
to
you
by
industry
standards
and
in
relation
MSU
's
net
income
and
cash
flow
.
''
``
Our
progress
will
determine
how
soon
we
can
reinstate
a
dividend
to
our
common
stockholders
,
he
said
.
''
The
company
last
paid
a
common
dividend
of
44.5
cts
a
share
in
July
1985
.
Lupberger
told
the
analysts
that
the
company
's
primary
objective
is
``
to
create
financial
strength
,
enough
strength
so
that
what
happened
to
us
and
our
stockholders
over
the
past
couple
of
years
never
happens
again
.
''
The
company
has
faced
regulatory
challenges
to
rates
proposed
to
cover
the
cost
of
its
Grand
Gulf
nuclear
plant
.
He
said
Middle
South
's
net
income
is
expected
to
post
``
modest
growth
''
over
the
next
three
years
.
In
1986
,
the
company
earned
451.3
mln
dlrs
or
2.21
dlrs
a
share
on
revenues
of
3.49
billion
dlrs
.
Lupberger
said
,
``
A
good
portion
of
the
improvement
projected
for
the
next
three
years
comes
from
keeping
the
lid
on
operating
and
maintenance
expenses

TAIWAN
COMPLAINS
ABOUT
SIZE
OF
RESERVES
Taiwan
's
foreign
exchange
reserves
,
swollen
by
strong
trade
surpluses
to
a
record
53
billion
U.S.
Dlrs
,
are
becoming
a
problem
,
government
officials
said
.
Official
figures
show
the
latest
level
compares
with
the
previous
record
of
51
billion
dlrs
on
March
4
and
about
26
billion
in
late
March
1986
.
Central
bank
Governor
Chang
Chi-cheng
told
reporters
the
increase
in
reserves
was
the
result
of
heavy
intervention
by
the
bank
on
the
local
interbank
market
.
It
bought
nearly
two
billion
U.S.
Dlrs
between
March
5
and
23
,
he
said
.
Wang
Chao-ming
,
vice
chairman
of
the
government
's
Council
for
Economic
Planning
and
Development
,
told
Reuters
the
rising
reserves
were
``
a
big
headache
for
Taiwan
.
''
He
said
the
government
expects
heavier
pressure
from
the
U.S.
,
Where
protectionist
bills
are
being
proposed
against
nations
such
as
Taiwan
and
Japan
with
large
trade
surpluses
with
the
U.S.
Wang
said
the
government
would
launch
new
measures
within
the
next
two
months
to
further
reduce
import
tariffs
and
open
the
market
wider
to
foreign
products
,
especially
those
from
the
U.S.
Wang
said
the
measures
aim
at
helping
reduce
Taiwan
's
trade
surplus
,
which
rose
to
2.73
billion
U.S.
Dlrs
in
the
first
two
months
of
1987
from
2.02
billion
a
year
earlier
.
Nearly
90
pct
of
the
surplus
was
with
the
U.S.
Vice
Economic
Minister
Wang
Chien-shien
agreed
with
Wang's
remarks
and
said
efforts
to
avert
U.S
.
Protectionism
were
running
out
of
time
.
``
We
must
do
it
quickly
or
face
retaliation
from
Washington
,
''
he
said
.
He
said
the
measures
would
include
removal
of
trade
barriers
on
insurance
and
inland
services
for
U.S.
Companies
.
Chang
Chi-cheng
said
the
central
bank
could
not
stop
buying
U.S
.
Dollars
because
of
heavy
sales
by
local
exporters
who
fear
the
strong
local
dollar
will
cause
them
exchange
losses
.
He
said
the
bank
is
studying
revision
of
the
foreign
exchange
rules
in
hope
of
further
reducing
currency
controls
,
but
declined
to
give
details
.
The
Taiwan
dollar
has
risen
about
15
pct
against
the
U.S.
Dollar
since
September
1985
.
It
opened
at
34.38
to
the
U.S.
Dollar
today
and
is
expected
to
rise
further
to
33
in
June
and
to
32
by
end-year

BANK
OF
FINLAND
TO
TRADE
IN
BANKS
'
CERTIFICATES
The
Bank
of
Finland
said
it
has
started
dealings
in
banks
'
certificates
of
deposits
(
CDs
)
with
immediate
effect
and
that
it
was
prepared
to
issue
its
own
paper
to
stimulate
operations
on
the
domestic
money
market
.
Bank
of
Finland
Governor
Rolf
Kullberg
told
a
news
conference
the
Bank
will
also
limit
credits
on
the
call
money
market
from
March
30
,
1987
,
by
introducing
a
maximum
credit
amount
and
a
penalty
rate
if
banks
exceed
this
ceiling
.
``
The
recent
introduction
of
three-month
money
and
these
new
regulations
are
decreasing
the
role
of
the
call
money
market
and
the
discount
rate
as
monetary
instruments
,
''
Kullberg
said
.
Bankers
welcomed
the
central
bank
measures
saying
these
were
needed
to
accelerate
the
domestic
money
market
.
The
Bank
of
Finland
had
never
before
been
allowed
to
issue
its
own
CDs
,
they
said
.
``
The
central
bank
for
the
first
time
has
an
instrument
with
which
it
really
can
influence
the
price
of
money
in
this
country
,
''
one
banker
said
.
Under
the
new
rules
banks
are
limited
to
call
money
credits
to
a
maximum
of
7.5
pct
of
the
total
of
their
equity
capital
and
cash
reserves
.
A
penalty
rate
of
interest
of
19
pct
is
now
introduced
if
the
limit
is
exceeded
.
Director
Sixten
Korkman
at
the
Bank
of
Finland
's
monetary
department
said
he
expected
the
bank
to
pursue
an
active
policy
on
the
interbank
market
as
an
issuer
of
own-CDs
.
``
We
are
free
to
do
it
,
so
maybe
on
Monday
we
will
issue
the
first
,
just
to
see
how
the
system
functions
.
Overall
I
think
we
will
issue
at
least
a
few
times
a
week
,
''
Korkman
told
Reuters
.
He
said
the
bank
was
likely
to
aim
at
CDs
with
a
three-month
maturity
at
first
as
the
market
was
best
developed
for
paper
of
that
maturity
.
The
Bank
of
Finland
introduced
last
December
three-month
credits
and
deposits
at
rates
determined
by
the
central
bank
and
the
commercial
banks
as
a
shift
away
from
the
traditional
overnight
call
money
market
.
Liquidity
on
the
call
credit
market
has
fallen
from
around
nine
billion
markka
in
early
December
to
167
mln
last
week
,
while
three-month
credits
have
risen
to
three
to
four
billion
.
On
the
interbank
market
there
has
been
an
increasing
trade
in
banks
'
CDs
,
estimated
to
be
some
eight
billion
markka
.
In
addition
,
commercial
paper
accounts
for
around
five
billion
markka
and
Treasury
Bills
two
billion

said
its

Morgan

the

seven
mln
Guinness
shares
in
addition
to
a
3.5
mln
dlr
loss
on
its
risk
arbitrage
operation

depressed

some
eight

Morgan

No

first
half

.
The
U.K.
Government
launched
an
investigation
into
the
affairs
of
Guinness
last
December
.
Public
concern
has
focused
on
the
way
Guinness
may
have
breached
U.K.
Company
law
and
the
Takeover
Code
by
prompting
others
to
support
its
share
price
during

Morgan
chief

Christopher

head
of

Graham

Another

resigned
late

the

been
``
one

that

``
I

the

BRAZILIAN
LABOUR
UNREST
SPREADS
,
MANY
BANKS
SHUT
Brazil
's
labour
unrest
is
spreading
,
with
many
banks
,
universities
and
government
statistical
offices
on
strike
and
more
pay
disputes
looming
.
Bankworkers
'
leaders
said
that
a
national
strike
launched
yesterday
to
press
for
a
100
pct
immediate
pay
rise
and
monthly
salary
adjustments
had
the
support
of
most
of
the
700,000
workforce
.
The
strike
today
closed
the
stock
exchanges
of
Sao
Paulo
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
.
For
the
government
the
one
positive
development
on
the
labour
front
was
the
gradual
return
to
work
of
the
nation's
40,000
seamen
,
who
began
a
national
strike
on
February
27
.
A
union
spokesman
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
told
Reuters
about
half
the
seamen
had
returned
to
work
after
accords
with
22
companies
and
that
the
strike
looked
close
to
an
end
.
Otherwise
the
labour
scene
looked
bleak
,
with
the
bank
strike
posing
the
most
serious
problems
for
Brazil's
crisis-laden
economy
.
``
If
this
goes
on
for
more
than
a
few
days
it
will
have
a
serious
effect
because
normal
financial
operations
will
grind
to
a
halt
,
''
said
a
western
diplomat
in
Sao
Paulo
.
Today
Brazil
's
50,000
university
teachers
in
the
42
federal
universities
launched
a
national
strike
,
with
a
broad
political
demand
as
well
as
a
pay
claim
.
David
Fleischer
,
head
of
the
political
science
department
in
Brasilia
university
,
told
Reuters
the
National
Association
of
Higher
Education
Teachers
wanted
a
full
congressional
inquiry
into
what
had
happened
to
government
education
funds
.
He
said
the
universities
were
strapped
for
cash
and
that
the
association
suspected
the
junior
partner
in
the
coalition
government
,
the
Liberal
Front
Party
,
PFL
,
of
using
education
funds
for
projects
which
had
helped
their
candidates
in
elections
.
The
PFL
holds
the
Education
Ministry
.
Hardly
any
sectors
of
the
economy
are
proving
immune
to
the
current
labour
unrest
,
caused
by
the
return
of
high
inflation
,
officially
pegged
at
33
pct
for
January-February
.
Other
possible
strikes
looming
include
stoppages
by
oil
industry
workers
and
social
security
workers

GREECE
SAYS
IT
HAS
RIGHT
ON
AEGEAN
OIL
DRILLING
Greece
,
responding
to
a
warning
by
Turkey
against
conducting
oil
activities
in
the
Aegean
Sea
,
said
today
it
had
the
right
to
decide
where
and
how
to
do
research
or
drilling
work
in
the
area
.
A
government
spokesman
said
the
Greek
position
was
made
clear
to
Turkey
's
ambassador
Nazmi
Akiman
when
he
met
Greek
Foreign
Affairs
Undersecretary
Yannis
Kapsis
last
week
.
Acting
Turkish
Prime
Minister
Kaya
Erdem
said
earlier
today
Greek
activities
in
the
northern
Aegean
contravened
the
1976
Berne
Agreement
which
set
the
framework
for
talks
on
the
Aegean
continental
shelf
disputed
between
Ankara
and
Athens
.
The
Greek
statement
today
said
,
``
Greece
is
not
prepared
to
give
up
even
a
trace
of
its
sovereignty
rights
to
the

.
It
has
been
stressed
to
...
Mr
Akiman
that
the
decision
where
or
how
to
drill
belongs
exclusively
to
the
Greek
government
.
''
``
The
Greek
government
has
repeatedly
let
the
Turkish
side
know
that
it
considers
the
1976
Berne
protocol
as
inactive
through
the
fault
of
Turkey
,

it
said
.
The
Greek
statement
said
Athens
was
ready
to
put
the
continental

The

A

at

said
his

had
been
asked
to
publicise
the
intervention
,
to
send
a
clear
signal
to
the

that
central

to

agreed
to
be

at
last

of
the

in

.
The

being

at

in
early

after
a

The

said
it

of

The

subsequently
being

The

was
reported
in

overnight
to
bolster
the
credibility
of
the
Paris

following
several
days
of

Pressure
developed
after
U.S.
Treasury
Secretary
James
Baker
repeated
earlier
statements
that
the
Reagan

had
no

for

,
apparently

Baker

will
range
between
90
cts
and
one
dlr
a

,
up
from
79
cts
a
share
last
year
,
Chairman
William
Brown
said
.
He
told
shareholders
the
company
has
a
190
mln
dlr
exposure
in
loans
to
Brazil
if
that
country
defaults
on
its
debt
payments
.
If
a
default
does
occur
,
it
would
first
quarter
earnings
by
about
five
cts
a
share
,
which
would
bring
the
bank
's
in
the
lower
level
of
the
estimated
range
,
he
added
.
Brown
noted
the
1986
first
quarter
net
included
a
17
cts
gain
from
loan
restructurings
which
will
not
appear
this
year
.
Brown
said
the
bank
's
other
nonperforming
assets
,
not
including
its
Brazilian
exposure
,
could
rise
to
over
700
mln
dlrs
at
the
end
of
this
quarter
compared
with
669
mln
dlrs
a
year
earlier
and
614
mln
dlrs
at
the
end
of
1986
.
He
said
the
increase
includes
all
of
its
Equadorian
loans
which
he
expects
will
be
ultimately
repaid
after
the
company
recovers
from
an
earthquake
earlier
this
year
.
Brown
said
the
increase
also
includes
some
Mexican
and
Venezuelan
loans
as
those
nations
are
also
facing
credit
problems
.
Brown
said
the
Bank
of
Boston
remains
``
cautiously
optimitic
about
the
full
year
even
if
our
Brazilian
exposure
were
to
be
on
nonaccural
all
year

''
In

,
the

JAPAN
'S

RATE
SEEN
RISING
TO
3.5
PCT
Japan
's
unemployment
rate
is
expected
to
continue
to
climb
to
about
3.5
pct
within
the
next
year
from
January
's
three
pct
record
,
senior
economists
,
including
Susumu
Taketomi
of
Industrial
Bank
of
Japan
,
said
.
December
's
2.9
pct
was
the
previous
worst
level
since
the
government
's
Management
and
Coordination
Agency
began
compiling
statistics
under
its
current
system
in
1953
.
``
There
is
a
general
fear
that
we
will
become
a
country
with
high
unemployment
,
''
said
Takashi
Kiuchi
,
senior
economist
for
the
Long-Term
Credit
Bank
of
Japan
Ltd
.
The
government
,
which
published
the
January
unemployment
figures
today
,
did
not
make
any
predictions
.
``
At
present
we
do
not
have
a
forecast
for
the
unemployment
rate
this
year
,
but
it
is
difficult
to
foresee
the
situation
improving
,
''
a
Labour
Ministry
official
said
.
Finance
Minister
Kiichi
Miyazawa
said
the
government
had
expected
the
increase
and
had
set
aside
money
to
help
300,000
people
find
jobs
in
fiscal
1987
beginning
in
April
.
Prime
Minister
Yasuhiro
Nakasone
told
a
press
conference
the
record
rate
underlines
the
need
to
pass
the
1987
budget
which
has
been
held
up
by
opposition
to
proposed
tax
reforms
.
The
yen
's
surge
has
caused
layoffs
in
the
mainstay
steel
and
shipbuilding
industries
.
Other
export-dependent
industries
,
such
as
cars
and
textiles
,
have
laid
off
part-time
employees
and
ceased
hiring
,
economists
said
.
Although
the
growing
service
industry
sector
has
absorbed
a
great
number
of
workers
the
trend
is
starting
to
slow
down
,
said
Koichi
Tsukihara
,
Deputy
General
Manager
of
Sumitomo
Bank
Ltd
's
economics
department
.
However
,
other
economists
disagreed
,
saying
the
service
sector
would
be
able
to
hire
workers
no
longer
needed
by
the
manufacturing
sector
over
the
next
five
years
.
The
economists
said
the
service
sector
should
grow
as
the
government
stimulates
domestic
demand
under
its
program
to
transform
the
economy
away
from
exports
.
Although
Japanese
unemployment
rates
appear
lower
than
those
of
other
industrialised
nations
,
methods
for
calculating
statistics
make
them
difficult
to
compare
,
economists
warned
.
``
The
three
pct
figure
could
translate
into
a
relatively
high
figure
if
European
methods
were
used
,
''
one
economist
said
.
More
than
half
of
January
's
170,000
increase

FTC
URGES
VETO
OF
GEORGIA
GASOLINE
STATION
BILL
The
Federal
Trade
Commission
said
its
staff
has
urged
the
governor
of
Georgia
to
veto
a
bill
that
would
prohibit
petroleum
refiners
from
owning
and
operating
retail
gasoline
stations
.
The
proposed
legislation
is
aimed
at
preventing
large
oil
refiners
and
marketers
from
using
predatory
or
monopolistic
practices
against
franchised
dealers
.
But
the
FTC
said
fears
of
refiner-owned
stations
as
part
of
a
scheme
of
predatory
or
monopolistic
practices
are
unfounded
.
It
called
the
bill
anticompetitive
and
warned
that
it
would
force
higher
gasoline
prices
for
Georgia
motorists
.
