While no firm figures exist, dealers in\\n  eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved\\n  in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that\\n  about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are\\n  outstanding.

BP had\\n  inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,\\n  which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude\\n  oil.\\n      The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management\\n  reorganisation of Standard in the past year.\\n      The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was\\n  now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the\\n  tender offer, Spedding said.\\n      BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major\\n  balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well\\n  received in the markets.\\n      The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially\\n  after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division\\n  -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come\\n  straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by\\n  other sectors.\\n  \\n\\n\",\n",

The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a\\n  charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in\\n  the third quarter.\\n      Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge\\n  resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full\\n  cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of\\n  Chartered Accountants.\\n      The company said it previously determined a write down of\\n  conventional oil and gas properties was not required at\\n  September 30, under the previous method of calculating the\\n  limitation of oil and gas values.\\n      Dome said the most significant accounting change under the\\n  new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in\\n  calculations instead of escalating price forecasts.\\n      Terms of Dome\\'s proposed debt restructuring plan preclude\\n  the company from making an accurate estimate of future\\n  financing costs, which are used in the new accounting\\n  calculations, it said.\\n      As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10\\n  pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially\\n  conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities\\n  and Exchange Commission, the company said.\\n      Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural\\n  gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71\\n  billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs.\\n      Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas\\n  operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion\\n  dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue.\\n      Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of\\n  Dome\\'s offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also\\n  contributed to the decline, it said.\\n      Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79\\n  pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985.\\n      Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago\\n  542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0\\n  mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs.\\n      Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained\\n  at prior year\\'s levels through new drilling activity and\\n  improvements in productivity.\\n      Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of\\n  lower domestic and export sales, it said.\\n      Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled\\n  86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year.\\n      Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day\\n  from 591.0 mcf a day.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

A\\n  conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and\\n  staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.\\n      Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an\\n  expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of\\n  the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup\\n  for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.\\n      Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so\\n  something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be\\n  implemented, an Agriculture Department source said.\\n      An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last\\n  week\\'s subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee\\n  chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the\\n  consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was\\n  necessary.\\n      Major commodity groups, including the National Corn\\n  Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen\\'s\\n  Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.\\n      But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill\\n  currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it\\n  should be extended to other crops.\\n      There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said\\n  Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.\\n      Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to\\n  decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the\\n  debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.\\n      Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce\\n  a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the\\n  argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major\\n  changes in the farm bill.\\n      \"Stenholm\\'s bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the\\n  timing,\" a congressional staff member said.\\n      Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an\\n  amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988\\n  feedgrains.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

       " 'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY\\n  The European Monetary System marks its\\n  eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money\\n  markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability\\n  in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,\\n  which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow\\n  fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.\\n      Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has\\n  been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike\\n  seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.\\n      And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as\\n  Europe\\'s common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality\\n  when Belgium minted the world\\'s first Ecu coin.\\n      But economists say members such as West Germany have so far\\n  blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system\\'s\\n  founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and\\n  former French President Valery Giscard d\\'Estaing.\\n      Under this phase, originally due to have started two years\\n  after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been\\n  transferred from national governments and central banks to an\\n  autonomous European Monetary Fund.\\n      But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in\\n  economic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is\\n  that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a\\n  situation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one\\n  economist who has closely watched the system\\'s development.\\n      The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on\\n  third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the\\n  system\\'s greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.\\n      Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and\\n  investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp\\n  rise of the West German mark severely strained the system.\\n      Another frustration has been Britain\\'s failure to lend the\\n  EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world\\n  currency, outside the system.\\n      No change in the British government\\'s attitude is expected\\n  before the country\\'s next general elections, due by mid-1988.\\n      Meanwhile, the system\\'s last realignment, the 11th since it\\n  was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC\\'s\\n  highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central\\n  Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.\\n      Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers\\n  hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.\\n      But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve\\n  more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical\\n  about the chances for any fundamental change.\\n      \"Technical measures won\\'t be enough to protect the EMS\\n  against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we\\n  must take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo\\n  de Corel of Kredietbank\\'s economic research department.\\n      Economists say the system\\'s fortunes now will depend\\n  largely on the success of an agreement last month among major\\n  industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar\\n  resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they\\n  predict.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the\\n  current year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline\\n  in output from the major Brent field, he said.\\n      Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas\\n  liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to\\n  be maintained in 1987, he said.\\n      A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey\\n  North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,\\n  Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5\\n  billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil\\n  price fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.\\n      Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North\\n  Sea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the\\n  cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.\\n      Day to day operating costs of the exploration and\\n  production sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target\\n  is to keep costs per barrel constant.\\n      The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to\\n  the discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to\\n  gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.\\n      Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a\\n  profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.\\n      Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit &lt;Shell\\n  U.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987\\n  were a \"bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.\"\\n      In November and December in particular, refining operations\\n  had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil\\n  product prices, he said.

There can be no further\\n  development for Japan without this transformation.\"\\n      Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have\\n  looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change.

In February, EC Industrial\\n  Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I\\n  only know that your government, under the leadership of\\n  Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less\\n  outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa\\n  report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"\\n      And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better\\n  answer than protectionism would be structural change within the\\n  Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report.

By January, its estimate of 1986\\n  planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.\\n      Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in\\n  1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year\\'s good\\n  demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts\\n  said those factors make cotton a profitable crop.\\n      \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is\\n  going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.\\n  Soybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill\\n  Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton\\n  market specialists.\\n      Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to\\n  increased acreage, analysts said.\\n      They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers\\n  who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans\\n  were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in\\n  government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government\\n  will not pick up the tab for storage.\\n      Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from\\n  participating in the program, which could result in more\\n  cotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of\\n  25 pct of a farmer\\'s base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman of\\n  Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to\\n  participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage \\n  they have.\\n      Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding\\n  Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the\\n  program. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" said\\n  one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part\\n  on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its\\n  annual meeting in late January.\\n      But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers have\\n  decided they should be in the program for security reasons.\\n  There\\'s a lot of comfort in knowing you\\'ll be guaranteed the\\n  government\\'s loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the\\n  program is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said Walter\\n  Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.\\n      Some cotton specialists said their expectations for\\n  increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday\\'s planting\\n  intentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now is\\n  based on information they gathered before their cotton program\\n  was announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She said\\n  traders will get a better idea of next year\\'s cotton output\\n  when the USDA\\'s planted acreage report is released on July 9.\\n      Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don\\'t think\\n  planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment\\n  rate,\" the difference between acreage planted and acreage\\n  harvested.\\n      Brown said the abandonment rate this year was \"pretty high\"\\n  at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing\\n  states. \"More normal would be about six pct,\" he said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

But economists said that\\n  seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the\\n  economy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And\\n  after a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.\\n      U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a\\n  seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804\\n  mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April\\n  1986.\\n      The rate at which permits were issued for future building\\n  climbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764\\n  mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.\\n      \"February\\'s weather is usually more adverse for home\\n  building. Because of seasonal factors it\\'s difficult to\\n  determine what this means for the economy down the road,\" said\\n  Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.\\n      The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for\\n  weather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures\\n  inflate the statistics.\\n      Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to\\n  building last month. But several believe that rates will now\\n  consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.\\n      \"Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying\\n  \\'Let\\'s do it now\\',\" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of\\n  Savings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much\\n  of the financing for home building.\\n      But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward\\n  potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and \\n  some overall improvement in the U.S. economy.\\n      He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early\\n  summer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last\\n  November, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.\\n      As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in\\n  the single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which\\n  typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high\\n  vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units\\n  following tax law changes effective January 1.\\n      Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317\\n  mln units.
